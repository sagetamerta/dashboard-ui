## About This Dashboard UI

This repository contains a Next.js project for a Dashboard UI focused on account finance and money management. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of your financial status, including income, expenses, savings, and investments.

### Features

- **Account Overview**: Get a quick snapshot of your financial status, including total balance, income, and expenses.
- **Transaction History**: Keep track of all your transactions in one place. You can filter and sort them by date, category, or amount.
- **Budget Planning**: Set monthly or yearly budgets for different categories and track your progress.
- **Investment Tracking**: Monitor your investments and their performance over time.
- **Financial Reports**: Generate detailed financial reports to understand your spending habits and identify areas for improvement.

Please note that this project is still under development, and more features will be added in the future. Contributions are welcome!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
